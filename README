## Introduction
This repository serves as a collection of Java-based projects developed for learning, practice, and real-world applications. Each project is designed to demonstrate key Java programming concepts, including:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- GUI Development (Swing, JavaFX)
- Networking and Web Applications
- File Handling and Database Integration

## Projects
### 1. Data Structures and Algorithms
This section includes implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms in Java, such as:
- Sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (Binary Search, DFS, BFS)
- Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Graphs

### 2. GUI Applications
A collection of Java-based GUI applications using Swing and JavaFX. Example projects include:
- **To-Do List**: A simple task manager with a graphical interface.
- **Calculator**: A basic calculator with arithmetic functions.
- **Notepad Clone**: A lightweight text editor with file-saving capabilities.

### 3. Web Development
Java-based web applications using frameworks like Spring Boot and Servlets. Examples include:
- **RESTful API**: A REST API for managing user data.
- **Online Bookstore**: A simple e-commerce backend.
- **Login System**: A user authentication system with database integration.

### 4. System Utilities
Utility programs designed for system automation and management:
- **File Organizer**: A script to sort and organize files into directories.
- **Log Analyzer**: A tool for analyzing and summarizing log files.

## Installation
To get started with these projects, clone the repository and navigate to the desired project folder:


git clone https://github.com/AngelosKontalis/Java_Projects.git
cd Java_Projects/<project-folder>


Ensure you have Java installed (JDK 11 or later recommended). Some projects may require additional dependencies, which will be listed in their respective directories.

## Usage
Each project contains a `README.md` file with specific instructions on how to compile and run the code. Generally, you can compile and run a Java program with:


javac Main.java
java Main


For Maven-based projects:

mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
